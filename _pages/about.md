Bio
====
My name is Tzeviya Sylvia Fuchs. I am a Computer-Science PhD candidate at [Bar-Ilan University](https://www1.biu.ac.il/)
under the supervision of [Prof. Joseph Keshet](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~jkeshet/). My research interests are in
machine-learning, deep-learning and their applications in ranking algorithms and speech processing, spcifically, keyword spotting and spoken term detection.
